# CyberStart Closure

The CyberStart Team [announced](https://releases.cyberstart.com/release/63fqE-important-update-cyberstart-platform-closure)* on December 19th that the platform will be closing by the end of January 2024. 

The website will stay online through GitHub Pages up until the domain's expiration on October 18th, 2025 (unless someone purchases the domain) and will receive no further updates.

## Walkthrough Requests
Requests can be submitted [here](https://github.com/PrinceBunBun981/cyberstart.dev/issues/new?assignees=&labels=request&projects=&template=walkthrough-request.md&title=) as an Issue. I no longer have access to CyberStart and won't be able to help, but others who are participating can submit PRs with walkthroughs, or simply [open an Issue](https://github.com/PrinceBunBun981/cyberstart.dev/issues/new) with some steps and I can format a page.
