### Briefing: 
Well, this gang loves their technology and bikes so much that they've combined them to make a custom bike lock!

We're concerned they're going to use this lock technology as part of the bigger bike heist, so it's worth us taking the time to try and figure out how to crack them now.
Take a look at this lock and see if you can unlock it.

**Tip:** **Unlock the bike lock** to get the flag.

### Hint:
The randomly generated numbers on the lock are binary. If you add them up what do you get? Still getting it wrong? Try inputting the result as a decimal rather than a binary.

### How to Solve: 
1. Concert the binary to decimals then add them together.
2. Enter the answer into the lock to get the flag.
