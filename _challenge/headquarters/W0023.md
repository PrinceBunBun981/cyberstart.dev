title: Too Much Text
permalink: /challenge/W0023/

### Briefing: 
Ok, this is really weird, one of the gang just emailed every other gang member a HUGE text file with loads of random Latin text in it. There must be a **secret code** hidden in it, right?

**Tip:** Find the **secret code**, that's the flag.

## Hint:
It's a lot of text, but have you tried just searching it for the words "secret" or "code" - sometimes the simplest things work!

### How to Solve: 
1. Use the built-in search feature, **CTRL + F** and search for `secret code`.
