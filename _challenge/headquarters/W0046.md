title: Phishing For Flemming
permalink: /challenge/W0046/
---

### Briefing: 
In our background research on one of the gang members, Flemming, we discovered their profile page on Ansikt, a Norwegian social media site. 

Luckily he's written all the details in English. We thought we might use them to create a phishing email and send it to him to try and get some further information, like his home address. 

Take a look at the profile, then create the phishing email with the right details, hit "Send email", and see if he sends anything back. 

** **Get all the details right, otherwise you can't send the email. When you do, you'll get the flag. 

### Hint:
It looks like she may have left herself a password hint in the source code and, luckily for us, the hint she mentions is all about what she writes on the blog.

### How to Solve: 
1. Enter the correct details and send the email:
