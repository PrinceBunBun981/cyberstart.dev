### Briefing: 
Whilst monitoring one of the gang, Ryosuke, we came across a file that he posted online. The problem is, the file doesn't seem to be opening. Take a look and see if you can work it out.

**Tip:** The flag is in the file.

### Hint:
Need help figuring out why the file won't open? Try going to the terminal and typing `$ man file`.

### How to Solve: 
1. Download the XML file given and check with a website like https://checkfiletype.com/ to make sure it is actually an XML.
2. In this case, it is not an XML and rather a JPEG.
3. Convert to a JPEG and look for the flag.
