title: Perplexed by Pixels

### Briefing: 
Well, one thing is for sure, the Yakoottees' scripting language of choice is Python. We've intercepted a lot of Python files from all over the place. So many, in fact, that we need someone to look at them and see what they do. Can have a look at this one to find out what it does?

**Tip:** The flag is in the file.

### Hint:
It looks like they're using the change in rgb values between the pixels to generate a set of numbers, which they're then converting to text with the help of an ASCII table. Work out the differences, do the conversion and there's your flag.

### How to Solve: 
1. Download the Python file and look at the source code with something like Notepad or Visual Studio Code to get the flag.
