### Briefing: 
We've been monitoring the Yakoottees for a while now, ever since we first came across one of their team trying to hack into large car manufacturers. Two of the gang members have recently started sending each other emails containing what we thought were zip files. But here's the thing, the emails don't contain any words and we can't seem to open the files. Why don't you take a look?

**Tip:** Open the file to get the flag.

### Hint:
Is it actually a zip file? Have you tried changing the extension?

### How to Solve: 
1. Download the ZIP file and figure out if itâ€™s a ZIP file, I used https://checkfiletype.com/. 
2. In this case it is not actually a ZIP and is a PDF.
3. Make sure you have "show file extenstions" on.
4. Then right-click the downloaded file and change the extension from .zip to .pdf.
5. Open the file for the flag.
