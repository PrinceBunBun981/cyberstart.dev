### Briefing: 
Well, that's a bit of luck. We've managed to get our hands on some details that allowed us to SSH into one of the Yakoottees private servers. They're a sophisticated gang, so they've probably hidden a few files in there. We've got you into their server, have a look and see if you can find anything.

**Tip:** The flag is in a file somewhere on the server.

### Hint:
There is a hidden directory on the server, try searching for `$ man ls` on Google to see how to view hidden directories.

### How to Solve: 
1. Use the `ls -a` command to list all files whether they are hidden or not.
2. Change the directory to the `secret-files` directory with `cd .secret-files`.
3. Then list the contents of the txt file with `cat flag.txt`.
