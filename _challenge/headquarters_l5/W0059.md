title: T-Shirt Trivia
permalink: /challenge/W0059

### Briefing: 
The Yakoottees have a number of side businesses that they use to launder money. One of them is an online T-shirt business. We've been monitoring the site to look for unusual activity and yesterday a T-shirt went up for sale and then ten minutes later was taken down. Luckily we've been running a tool, which takes copies of all new pages before they get removed.

There's something odd about this page. The T-shirt for sale doesn't seem to be designed like the rest (which mostly feature cars); this one has what looks like a QR code on it. Take a look and see what you think.

**Tip:** Read the code to get the flag. Not all QR code readers will show non-URL data, so you may need to try a few!

### Hint:
It's the QR code! Read it to get the flag. Oh, and if you don't have a QR code reader use zbarimg, type `man zbarimg` to get started.

### How to Solve: 
1. Right-click the actual QR code and download the file.
2. Upload it to a website like https://4qrcode.com/scan-qr-code.php to get the flag.
