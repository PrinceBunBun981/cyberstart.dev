### Briefing: 
The Yakoottees aren't just a criminal gang, they're also a group of talented car engineers. Their organisation has a front - a high-end car repair shop called Yakoo Cars.

Naturally, we took a thorough look through their website to see if we could find anything interesting. One thing we found was a little strange: an empty page. Empty, apart from a message saying "Error. Cookie `user` expected.". Ordinarily we wouldn't think anything of it, but the page name is "Secret", so we should investigate.

We think only the boss Yaka Matsu should have access. Take a look and see if you can get around the cookie issue.

**Tip:** Use the browser extension to help add a new cookie.

### Hint:
If the page is saying a cookie user is expected, maybe you need to create one for the boss Yaka Matsu? Oh, and don't forget that the cookie name "user" will probably need to be all lower case.

### How to Solve: 
1. Click the cookie located at the top right of the page to add a cookie.
2. In the **Cookie Name** field, add "user", and in the **Cookie Value** field, add "Yaka Matsu".
3. Click **Add cookie and reload page** to add the cookie and get the flag.
