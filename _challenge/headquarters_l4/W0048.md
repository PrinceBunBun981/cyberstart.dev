### Briefing: 
It looks like The Choppers might know we're trying to get into their intranet. 

They've currently got it locked down by disabling the login form. We still have a correct username and password - can you find a way to get in? 

**Tip:**â€¯Log in successfully and you'll get the flag. 

### Hint:
Hmm, it looks like they didn't lock down the login form entirely; all they've done is disable the form's input button. Could you maybe use Developer Tools to get around that?

### How to Solve: 
1. Right-click the Intranet Locked button and go into Inspect Element. 
2. Expand the actions field. 
3. In the input line, remove the `disabled` at the end. 
    1. `<input type="submit" value="Intranet Locked" class="btn" disabled>`
4. Go back and click the Intranet Locked button to log in.
