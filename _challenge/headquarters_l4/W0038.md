### Briefing: 
Our field agent has managed to get some login details from one of the gang, Magdalina. We believe she uses the details to SSH into a remote server to view a particular file that might be important. 

These are the details we have: 

**IP address:** 192.162.132.199 
**Username:** maggie 
**Password:** ubersecurepw 

Why don't you try it yourself using the secure terminal we've provided and see what you find. 

**Tip:** The terminal uses non-default implementation of OpenSSH and only accepts common formats. The flag is the name of the file. 

### Hint:
Never used SSH? Don't worry. Type `$ ssh user@ipaddress` from the command line in the terminal where user is the username and ipaddress is the IP address of course. Once you're in, you should see a file there. Its name is the flag.

### How to Solve: 
1. Use the `ssh` command to login to Maggie’s account: `ssh -l maggie 192.162.132.199` and when prompted to enter the password, enter `ubersecurepw`.
1. Then use the `ls` command to list the files.
