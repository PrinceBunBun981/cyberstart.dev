title: Phishing For Flemming
permalink: /challenge/W0046/
---

### Briefing: 
In our background research on one of the gang members, Flemming, we discovered their profile page on Ansikt, a Norwegian social media site. 

Luckily he's written all the details in English. We thought we might use them to create a phishing email and send it to him to try and get some further information, like his home address. 

Take a look at the profile, then create the phishing email with the right details, hit "Send email", and see if he sends anything back. 

**Tip:** Get all the details right, otherwise you can't send the email. When you do, you'll get the flag. 

### Hint:
Flemming has been very forthcoming on his profile page, leaving lots of information about himself. You just need to find the specific information we're planning to use in the phishing email, fill in the gaps and hit "send".

### How to Solve: 
1. Enter the correct details and send the email:
    1. Valerie
    2. Trondheim
    3. June
    4. c
    5. r
    6. Barneys
    7. Seaview
