### Briefing: 
We've recovered a bunch of .gif files from an old hard drive one of the gang members threw out. We thought they were innocent enough until we started wondering whether they were all actually GIF files. 

Check your email, download the files and see if you can find out what's going on. 

**Tip:**â€¯The flag is in one of the files. 

### Hint:
Can we be sure they're all really .gif files? In previous cases the CPA have solved we've seen gang members change the extension on files so it looks like something different. Perhaps try opening the files in a text editor to see if they are actually all .gifs.

### How to Solve: 
1. Download and check each file, in my case `cat-gif-06.gif` was not an actual GIF file. 
2. When you find the file that is not a GIF, right-click it and open with Notepad or any other word processor to get the flag.
