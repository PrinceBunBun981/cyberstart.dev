title: Flow with Conditionals
permalink: /challenge/E0006/
---

### Briefing: 
Now you know the basics it's time to teach you one of the most useful things in programming, **conditionals**. Using **"if statements"** you can get a program to be dynamic and flow the way you want it to, based on the information it receives. If you're ready, let's go!

### Hint: 
Using the examples, try to create the if/elif/else logic for Challenge 1.

You can re-use most of your code from Challenge 1 in the other two challenges.

### Code Solution: 
The following code is the solution to this challenge. Please note that there may be alternative ways to complete this challenge.

  <summary></summary>
  <pre><code>
# CHALLENGE 1: Check if the number of people is lower than the capacity.
#              If it is, print "success"
#              If the number of people is higher than the capacity,
#              print "too full"
#              If the number of people is equal to the capacity,
#              print "maximum people"
if people < capacity:
  print("success")
elif people > capacity:
  print("too full")
elif people == capacity:
  print("maximum people")

# CHALLENGE 2: Set the value of the people variable to 500.
#              Then run the same check from CHALLENGE 1 again.
people = 500
if people < capacity:
  print("success")
elif people > capacity:
  print("too full")
elif people == capacity:
  print("maximum people")

# CHALLENGE 3; Set the value of the people variable to 50.
#              Then run the same check from CHALLENGE 1 again.
people = 50
if people < capacity:
  print("success")
elif people > capacity:
  print("too full")
elif people == capacity:
  print("maximum people")
