### Briefing: 
So now you know all about conditionals it's time to supercharge them with **logic**! This is where we get to the very core of how a computer thinks, using simple **binary** we have the values **1** and **0**, which relate to **True** and **False**. Once you master this there will be no holding you back!

### Hint: 
Have a look at Truth Tables in Logic if you're interested in knowing more.
