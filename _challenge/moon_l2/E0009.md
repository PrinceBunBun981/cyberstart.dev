title: Hooray for Arrays
permalink: /challenge/E0009/
---

### Briefing: 
If you thought functions were useful just wait until you learn about **arrays**! They're simple things, just **collections of data**, but they're really handy for programming. In this lesson you'll learn how to **create** them, plus **add** and **remove** items in them, and more.

### Hint: 
Remember that we start counting arrays from 0.

So the fourth value in an array will be array[3]

0, 1, 2, 3. That's four values but the highest number is 3

### Code Solution: 
The following code is the solution to this challenge. Please note that there may be alternative ways to complete this challenge.

  <pre><code class="language-python">
# CHALLENGE 1: Create an array with the following values in it in
#             order:
#             42, 1337, "Coffee", "Anonymous" then print the array.
ch_1 = [42, 1337, "Coffee", "Anonymous"]
print(ch_1)

# CHALLENGE 2: Add two more values to the end of the array you created
#              in CHALLENGE 1: "Blue", "Sky" then print the array.
ch_1.append("Blue")
ch_1.append("Sky")
print(ch_1)

# CHALLENGE 3: Print the fourth value in the array you created in
#              CHALLENGE 1.
print(ch_1[3])

# CHALLENGE 4: Create a dict that includes the following values in
#              order: "Subject": "Hacking", "Grade": "A".
ch_4 = {"Subject": "Hacking", "Grade": "A"}

# CHALLENGE 5: Print the grade value in the dictionary you created in
#              CHALLENGE 4.
print(ch_4["Grade"])
