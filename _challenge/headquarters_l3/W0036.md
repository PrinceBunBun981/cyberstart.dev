### Briefing: 
Recruit, we've intercepted some chatter between Chopper gang members talking about one of their competitor's machines. They all have unique identifiers and we think one of those identifiers is **hidden in some code** we found. One of the other agents has emailed it to you. Take a look and see if you can **find the identifier**. 

**Tip:** The identifier is the flag you need. 

### Hint:
Hmm, it can't be as simple as... no, hold on. The first four letters spell "BEST", if you reverse them. Maybe that's a clue?

### How to Solve: 
1. Reverse "TSEBEHTSKOOLTIDEHGUYXELCIHEVTEGRATEWDLUOHS" 
    1. "SHOULD WE TARGET VEHICLE XYUGHED IT LOOKS THE BEST"

### Answer:
- XYUGHED
