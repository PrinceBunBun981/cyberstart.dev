### Briefing: 
We've just intercepted an email from one of the gang members with a file attached called "**passgen.py**". It looks like a **Python** script. 

We've heard that the gang is looking for a way to make their passwords more secure, perhaps using code like this to generate them. See if you can **run the code** so we know exactly what it does. 

**Tip:** The output from the code is the flag you need. 

### Hint:
Running a python script from the terminal is as simple as `$ python filename` where filename is the name of the file of course.

### How to Solve: 
1. Use the `python` command to run the python script in the Linux terminal: `python passgen.py`
