title: Route into the Router
permalink: /challenge/W0032/

### Briefing: 
Good news, we've managed to get access to the login page for one of the gang's home routers. Useful... if only we knew the username and password. I wonder if they've been lazy and left the router's **default username and password** active? The router is just a standard Nethub 5000. 

**Tip:** Find the correct username and password then login, to get the flag. 

### Hint:
We've given you access to a search engine called Moogle. Try searching for the Nethub 5000 and see if you can find a mention of the default username and password online.

### How to Solve: 
1. In Moogle click search. 
2. In Router use the username admin, and password password.
