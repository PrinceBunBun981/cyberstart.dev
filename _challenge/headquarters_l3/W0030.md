title: The Competitor Revealed
permalink: /challenge/W0030

### Briefing: 
We've intercepted some encrypted text from one of the gang members, which we think might include the **name of the competitor company** that they intend to target. 

We know it uses a letter **Substitution Cipher** and luckily we have some **Frequency Analysis** counts. At CPA we have our very own tool for helping agents to break this kind of encryption. Use it to try and work out what the text says. 

**Tip:** The flag is the name of the competitor company. 

### Hint:
Keep trying different letters until you have a word that makes sense. A common approach with Frequency Analysis is to try two and three letter words first - they are likely to be words such as: is, and, the, are. Once you have those and some letters unravelled, things might start to become clearer.

### How to Solve: 
1. Enter the following letters in to decipher the text:
    1. **T H E O S A I C N G W B R M D U**
2. The deciphered text is "THE TARGET IS ASBOR WHO HAS THE BEST WOOD CUTTING MACHINES"

### Answer
- ASBOR
