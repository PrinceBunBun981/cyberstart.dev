title: Dante In Command?
permalink: /challenge/W0034/
---

### Briefing: 
We **found a file** in an intercepted email from one of The Chopper gang members, Dante, but it needs to be **run from the command line** in order to make it work. 

We think it might be a program the gang are writing to gain access to their competitors' computers, so it's important we check it out. 

**Tip:** Run the program from the command line; the flag will be in the output. 

### Hint:
Did you notice the URL on the successful transfer page? I wonder what would happen if you changed the parameters and submitted it again?

### How to Solve: 
1. Use `ls` to list all of the files in the directory.
2. Notice there is a file named `passcrack`, use `./passcrack` to generate the flag.
