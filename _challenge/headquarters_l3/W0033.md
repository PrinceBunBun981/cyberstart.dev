### Briefing: 
Agent, we've just intercepted a message between two of The Choppers talking about how they intend to steal money from the bank account of a different competitor to fund their plans. 

It said they've found a weakness in the money transfer tool on the Global Bank website. **We've just successfully put through a test transfer**, can you prove it's vulnerable by transferring **1000** to a bank account called **cpatestreceiver** from **cpatestsender**. 

**Tip:** Sometimes URLs can be manipulated to bypass security. 

### Hint:
Did you notice the URL on the successful transfer page? I wonder what would happen if you changed the parameters and submitted it again?

### How to Solve: 
1. Change the details in the URL as follows:
    1. `amount=100`
    2. `from=cpatestsender`
    3. `to=cpatestreciever`
2. The URL should look like this: `https://www.bankwithglobal.com/transfer?amount=1000&from=cpatestsender&to=cpatestreceiver`
3. Enter the new URL into the builtin address bar to get the flag.
