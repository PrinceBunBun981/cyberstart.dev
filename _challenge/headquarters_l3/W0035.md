### Briefing: 
Whilst taking a look around The Choppers' intranet site, one of our agents found a game that gang members like to play to pass a little time. We need you to find out how the game is won so we can better assess the capabilities of gang members problem solving skills. 

**Tip:**â€¯If you figure it out and you're persistent enough, you'll see the flag! 

### Hint:
Sometimes working out a problem just requires a bit of persistence. Try refreshing the page, does anything happen?

### How to Solve: 
1. Keep refreshing the page until you roll doubles.
