### Briefing: 
So you've already learnt about **strings**, but did you know there are some other really useful things you can do with them? Things like **concatenation** and using **string specifiers**. Take a look.

### Hint: 
Remember that `%s` is a placeholder for Strings.

 `%d` is a placeholder for numbers (think of d for digit).

 `%f` is a placeholder for floats (remember these are numbers with a decimal point)

Make sure you create the requested variables, and use them in a format string to print the specified sentence.

### Code Solution: 
The following code is the solution to this challenge. Please note that there may be alternative ways to complete this challenge.

# CHALLENGE 1: Save the integer 5 in the variable ch1_1, and
#              the string "robots" in the variable ch1_2
#              Use a format string to print the following sentence:
#              There are 5 robots in the room
ch1_1 = 5
ch1_2 = "robots"
print("There are %d %s in the room" % (ch1_1, ch1_2))
