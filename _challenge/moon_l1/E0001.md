### Briefing: 
Good morning agent, welcome to your first day of training on the Moon Base. Our goal on this level is to teach you some **programming basics**. We use a programming language called **Python** at the CPA and today we're going to start with a simple task - teaching you a few common things like **code comments** and using the **print function**.

We have an interactive **code editor** for you to learn with, the CPA MoonCoder. Simply change the code in the editor on the left side and click the green "Submit code" button to make it run. You'll then see the **output of your code** (along with a flag to submit if you get it correct) on the right side.

And don't forget, if you get stuck you can click "Use a hint". Whilst you're in training you won't lose any points for doing so.

### Hint: 
In the example code we're printing the string "text" and the number 42. See if you can copy these, but instead print the string "Hello, World" and the number 1337.

### Code Solution:
The following code is the solution to this challenge. Please note that there may be alternative ways to complete this challenge.
