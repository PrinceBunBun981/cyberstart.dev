### Briefing: 
Next, let's take a look at something called **variables**, a really simple programming concept. It's basically just a box with a label that can hold something, but a thing you'll find **very useful** as you go on to write more advanced code.

### Hint: 
You need to print the 4 variables described in the comments. Keep in mind, you only use quotation marks around Strings (text). Don't use them for anything else!

### Code Solution: 
- May be broke
