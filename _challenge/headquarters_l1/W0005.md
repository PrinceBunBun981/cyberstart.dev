### Briefing: 
Here's an interesting one for you agent - on the weekend the gang released what looks like a one page website advertising an upcoming bike race they're organising. Being cyber detectives we're naturally curious that things might not be as they seem. Have a look at the site - it looks like there are just two images on the page, a logo and the poster, can you **find** anything suspicious, maybe **some text**?

**Tip:** Find the **hidden** clue and it'll lead you to the flag. 

### Hint: 
Try highlighting the whole page (i.e. select all), does it reveal anything else?

### How to Solve: 
1. Click CTRL + A to highlight the whole page, notice some text that says "Go to /secret.html".
2. Change the URL in the challenge's address bar from `https://www.canalbikerace.com/` to `https://www.canalbikerace.com/secret.html` to get the flag.
