### Briefing: 
Agent, we think we might have a way to log into a social media account of one of the gang using the site's password reset form. We have two key pieces of information: his **username** and his **favourite color**. We just need his **age** and we'll be able to log in - can you **guess it from the information we already have?**

**Tip:** **Get the age correct** and submit the form to get the flag.

### Hint: 
Look at the username, does that give you any hint at what year he might have been born?

### How to Solve: 
1. His **username** is **lars_1986**, there is a year in his username, most likely his birth year.
2. Subtract 1986 from the current year and enter it into the **age** field.
