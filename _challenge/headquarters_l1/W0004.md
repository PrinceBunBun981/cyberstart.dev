### Briefing: 
During our initial analysis of the gang we noticed something strange - they created lists of their customers and shared it between their bike shops, and each customer had a unique pattern of numbers after their name. One of our agents thinks the pattern of numbers might be **encoded words**. We also noticed the **numbers never went above 26**, that might be relevant. Can you work out what it means?

**Tip:** **Decode the message** to get the secret word and use that as the flag.

### Hint: 
Could the numbers represent letters somehow? Think about the position of letters in the alphabet.

### How to Solve: 
1. The different names with numbers at ends are...
    1. Jan De Jong (20, 8, 5)
    2. Lars Jansen (19, 5, 3, 18, 5, 20)
    3. Gerrit Vries (23, 15, 18, 4)
    4. Merel De Vries (9, 19)
    5. Sanne Bakker (23, 8, 5, 5, 12)
2. The numbers after the names correspond to letters in the alphabet.
```
A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4, E = 5
F = 6, G = 7, H = 8, I = 9, J = 10
K = 11, L = 12, M = 13, N = 14, O = 15
P = 16, Q = 17, R = 18, S = 19, T = 20
U = 21, V = 22, W = 23, X = 24, Y = 25
Z = 26
```
3. The result is: **the secret code is wheel**

### Answer:
- Wheel
