### Briefing: 
Our team have been monitoring some text message chatter between two of the senior gang members over the last week. There was nothing interesting of note until suddenly all their messages started coming through **mixed up**. 

At first we thought it might be a technical problem, but then it occurred to us that they might be deliberately **encoding the messages** somehow. 

I've had one of the agents forward you one of the messages, see if you can **decode it**. 

**Tip:** **Decode the message**, we think it mentions **two colors**, combine them (e.g. **redgreen**) and that's the flag. 

### How to Solve: 
1. The mixed up message is "**IBEK OCLLCEITNO EW LPNA OT ATEK SI LBEU RO EYLLWO**"
2. You don’t really need to unscramble everything only the words that look like colors: 
    1. LBEU – blue 
    2. EYLLWO – yellow 

### Answer
- blueyellow
