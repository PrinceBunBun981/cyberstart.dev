### Briefing: 
Agent, quick question for you. One of the team sent me a screenshot of his filesystem browser with a bunch of files she recovered from a memory stick one of the gang discarded. She's asking if any of them are **executable files**. Take a look and let me know.

**Tip:** The **name of the executable file (including the extension)** is the flag.

### Hint:
If there are any file extensions you don't recognise why not try googling them to see whether they are executables.

### How to Solve: 
1. Go through the list of files and extensions.
2. In the list there is only one executable, **old-bike-parts.com**

### Answer
- old-bike-parts.com
