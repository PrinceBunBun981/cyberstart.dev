title: Lost Key

### Briefing: 
Our agent on the ground noticed a USB key discarded outside The Yakoottees' garage and he's just uploaded the files for analysis. It's probably nothing important; they just look like innocent jpg files. One looks corrupt, however. Can you take a look just to be sure we don't miss anything?

**Tip:** The flag is in the file.

### Hint:
Are you sure it's a Jpeg?

### How to Solve: 
1. Download the file and put it into a file checker, https://www.checkfiletype.com/.
2. You can see the file is a PDF, rename the extension to `.pdf` and open the file to get the flag.
