### Briefing: 
Remember ChatZap from a previous challenge? We need to get back in but it looks like they've changed their security. Take a look.

**Tip:** Log back in to get the flag.

### Hint:
Hmm, it looks like the page uses a JavaScript based security check, but there's no relevant javascript on the page. Maybe it's in a separate file?

### How to Solve: 
1. Go into the console and type `password` to get the password needed to login.
