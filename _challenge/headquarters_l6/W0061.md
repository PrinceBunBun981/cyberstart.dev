### Briefing: 
It looks like the Yakoottees are preparing for an attack and the senior members of the gang seem to be providing the funds. We've intercepted a message containing what we think are bank details, but they're encrypted. If you could decrypt them, we'd have a better idea of who is behind the plan.

**Tip:** The decrypted bank account number is the flag.

### Hint:
You know, that code looks awfully like a hex encoded number. Maybe you should find out how to translate that to text.

### How to Solve: 
1. One again using https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash will allow us to decrypt the hash given. The hash, `4163636f756e74204e756d6265723a2037323434303937333531` returns with `Account Number: 7244097351`

### Answer:
- 7244097351
