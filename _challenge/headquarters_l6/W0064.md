### Briefing: 
The Yakoottees are preparing their break-in, so we're doing a full review of everything they have running. We found a service running on the server services.cyberprotection.agency, port 8203. Connect to the service and find what is on there to see if it's related.

**Tip:** Connect and look at the banner for the flag.

### Hint:
Many ports have services running on them that provide banners, which tell you the service name and sometimes the version. You can connect to a remote port using Netcat, use `$ nc -help` in the terminal if you need info on usage.

### How to Solve: 
1. In the CyberStart VM, connect to the server using `netcat services.cyberprotection.agency 8203` to get the flag.
