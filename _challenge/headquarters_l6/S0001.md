### Briefing: 
Were you involved in the previous level when we needed someone to SSH into one of the Yakoottees' servers and take a look around? Well, we need to do it again. It seems they're becoming a little smarter about hiding their files. Take a look and see what you can find.

SSH sessions only last 60 minutes, after that you will need to reload the page to get a new one.

**(The details given are dynamically generated, they will be different each time.)**

**Tip:** The flag is in a file somewhere on the server.

### Hint:
There is a directory here that has been hidden in plain sight. Try comparing the output of `$ ls` with the output of `$ ls` in a different directory.

### How to Solve: 
1. Open a SSH connection using the credentials provided in the Briefing.
2. Navigate through the different folders using the cd command then use `ls -a` to list the contents of each folder.
3. Once you find the `camouflage` file, use `cat camouflage` to print the contents of the file.
