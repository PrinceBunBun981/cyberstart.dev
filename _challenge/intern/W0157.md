### Briefing: 
Intern, I hope you know how to use a calculator? Of course you do. In theory you should be able to bypass this security gateway to a warehouse we believe holds clues to the whereabouts of a gang we are in hot pursuit of.

The thing is, the gateway was created by someone who loves doing everything **super fast**! You **only get 0.1 seconds** to answer the question asked by the gateway. Can you find a way around it? We're not able to **form**ulate an **action** quick enough.

**Tip:** Bypass the calculator lock to get the flag.

### Hint: 
Try watching the source code as you are spinning a new set of numbers. What changes when the spin is happening and then gets removed when the calculator gets locked?

### How to Solve: 
1. Right-click the "Submit Answer" button. 
2. Click **Inspect**. 
3. Take note of this line: 
`<form class="form" action="/flashfast/answer" id="calc-form">`
4. Click the "Spin for question" button. 
5. Go back to that line and it should've changed: 
`<form class="form" action="" id="calc-form">`
6. Edit the `action` and add `/flashfast/answer` to it. 
7. Solve the equation normally and input the answer. 
8. Click the "Submit Answer" button to get the flag.
