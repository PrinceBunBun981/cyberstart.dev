### Briefing: 
We've found a profile page of a known hacker that we need to get in contact with but most of the information visible on the page is useless to us. However, there is one secret real way to contact him that he's managed to inject on the page - a hidden email address. Intern, we need you to find his email address! 

**Tip:** The email address is the flag. 

### Hint: 
Try highlighting the whole page (i.e. select all) to find text that might be the same colour as the background. 

### How to Solve: 
1. Using CTRL + A will highlight the whole page revealing the email hidden underneath the “Send me an email” button.
