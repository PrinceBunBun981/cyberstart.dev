title: The Final Countdown

### Briefing: 
The main tourism website for Barcelona has been hacked. The hackers have devised a program that changes the content of the website based on a timer. You can imagine the confusion this has been causing the sites visitors! Can you figure out how we can get the secret code to stop this program from running?

It'll be tricky - they appear to use a **script** to **join multiple sets** of content together and finally **send the joined sets** to somewhere else to **validate**.

**Tip:** The characters at the 5 URLs change quickly, but computers can be far quicker than humans, especially when getting data!

### Hint: 
With a little code you could probably get the contents from those 5 URLs as strings and join them together. With all the parts together, it'll just be a case of sending to the final URL. Pay attention to the formats shown!



### How to Solve: 
1. Click on one of the links, or simply go to https://roambarcelona.com/
2. Run the following code a few times.
```js
var logFetch = "";
fetch('https://roambarcelona.com/clock-pt1?verify=Na2Q%2BeqhSP5hTRLDwpTNoA%3D%3D').then(res => res.text()).then(dat => logFetch = logFetch + dat);
fetch('https://roambarcelona.com/clock-pt2?verify=Na2Q%2BeqhSP5hTRLDwpTNoA%3D%3D').then(res => res.text()).then(dat => logFetch = logFetch + dat);
fetch('https://roambarcelona.com/clock-pt3?verify=Na2Q%2BeqhSP5hTRLDwpTNoA%3D%3D').then(res => res.text()).then(dat => logFetch = logFetch + dat);
fetch('https://roambarcelona.com/clock-pt4?verify=Na2Q%2BeqhSP5hTRLDwpTNoA%3D%3D').then(res => res.text()).then(dat => logFetch = logFetch + dat);
fetch('https://roambarcelona.com/clock-pt5?verify=Na2Q%2BeqhSP5hTRLDwpTNoA%3D%3D').then(res => res.text()).then(dat => logFetch = logFetch + dat);
// A delay is needed to ensure each part has been fetched.
setTimeout(() => {
  fetch('https://roambarcelona.com/get-flag?verify=Na2Q%2BeqhSP5hTRLDwpTNoA%3D%3D&string=' + logFetch).then(res => res.text()).then(dat => console.log(dat))
}, 1000)
```
3. Don't worry if something like `Time till code change: 10 secs<br>Sorry, that's not correct` is outputted, simply run the code again.
