### Briefing: 
Weâ€™ve been working with a well-known spaceflight agency to help us launch a satellite into space. The satellite will monitor criminal cyber gangs and help us in our effort of preventing large-scale attacks.

They have given us a command that triggers a **launch sequence** that will send a rocket with the satellite attached to its destination. The command is `launchRocket()` Can you figure out how we can run it so we can send this satellite to work?

**Tip:** You can run JavaScript commands in the **Console**.

### Hint: 
Look for a button that will open a Console for you to run the command within.

### How to Solve: 
1. Open the console by clicking **F12** or **CTRL + Shift + I**.
2. Type the command `launchRocket()` to reveal the flag.
