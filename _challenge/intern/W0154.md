### Briefing: 
Can you believe it, we think the Yakoottees are now planning to disrupt the flow of traffic in a major city! We need to **find the URL** of the **forum** they're using to communicate with each other. Can you figure out what the URL is and get to it? The **other links may be helpful**.

**Tip:** Find the url of the forum to get the flag.

### Hint: 
Take a look at the source code of the site, in particular the 5 nav links. Are there any clues in the deactivated link or the other working links, that would help us establish what the URL would be?

### How to Solve: 
1. Click on **Cycling Maps** to open that page.
2. Right-click on **Forum**.
3. Click **Inspect**.
4. In `<li data-sd="my-chat" data-id="312324494" class="disabled">Forum</li>` the `my-chat` will be used in the URL.
5. In the address bar (in CyberStart, not your browser), change `my-routes` to `my-chat`.
6. Click **Enter** and the flag will be given.
