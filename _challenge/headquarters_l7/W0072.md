title: Docking Port
permalink: /challenge/W0072/

### Briefing: 
We have come across a site, which we believe is run by one of the Chiquitoo gang members, that sends information out on the port 1337. We've got a terminal tool you can use that is restricted to do just what you need. See if you can use it to get the information so we can find out what the site is being used for.

**Tip:** Get the information to get the flag.

### Hint:
Netcat can be used to listen on a port. Type `$ nc -h` to see how to run the command.

### How to Solve: 
1. Listen to the port using the `nc` command, `nc -l 1337`
