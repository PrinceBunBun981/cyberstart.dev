title: All Zipped Up

### Briefing: 
Recruit, we need your scripting skills again. One of our field agents has managed to turn one of the Chiquitoos' to act as an informant. He has obtained access to a zip file from one of the senior gang members but it's password protected and he doesn't know the password (although we're pretty sure it starts with "Cola"). We've got a Python script that might help us brute force it but we think it needs some modifications.

**Tip:** Open the zip file to get the flag. And don't forget you can use your local terminal to help.

### Hint:
We believe the password starts with "Cola" and ends in numbers and upper or lower case characters.

### How to Solve: 
1. In the Python script, the `alphabet` variable, add the entire alphabet with all caps and all numbers.
    1. From: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
    2. To: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890`
2. Change the `first_half_password` variable to `Cola`, from `Password`.
3. Run the script normally with both files being in the same directory.
4. Open the extracted file, `Flag.txt`, to get the flag.
