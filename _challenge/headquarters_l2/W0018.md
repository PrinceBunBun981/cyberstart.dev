title: Broken Link
permalink: /challenge/W0018

### Briefing: 
Here's a weird one agent, there's now a **link** on the Slootmaekers login page for an **admin login**. We wanted to take a look but the link **doesn't seem to work**. Can you figure out how to get to it?

**Tip:** **Get to the admin login page** to get the flag.

### Hint:
How about looking at the source code of the site to see where the link is meant to be pointing to? You could then copy and paste it into the browser window URL field.

### How to Solve: 
1. Change the suffix in the URL from `/login` to `/adminarea/login`
