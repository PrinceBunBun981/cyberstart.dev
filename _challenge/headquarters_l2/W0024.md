### Briefing: 
It looks like part of the heist is underway, they're trying to hack the Amsterdam City Bike Initiative servers as we speak! We need to help them out, see if you can **change the server configuration** settings to make the server login rules **more secure**.

### How to Solve: 
1. Change `PasswordMinLength` to `16`.
