### Briefing: 
We have an undercover agent in one of the Slootmaekers bike shops, posing as a bike mechanic. We need to send him an urgent message but the only phone he has is one the gang gave him and may be monitoring. We have a specific **Substitution Cipher** we can use - quickly **encode the message** and **send it**.

**Tip:** Correctly **encrypt the message** and **send it** to get the flag.

### Hint:
Simply replace whatever each letter in the message is with whatever letter the key tells you to change. For example, if the key shows A = S, change all A's in the messages to S's.

### How to Solve: 
1. Convert **GANG MAY KNOW YOUR IDENTITY ABORT ABORT MEET AT SAFE HOUSE B** using the cypher:
```
A = F   B = G   C = H   D = I   E = J   F = K   G = L   H = M   I = N   J = O   K = P   L = Q   M = R   N = S   O = T   P = U   Q = V   R = W   S = X   T = Y   U = Z   V = A   W = B   X = C   Y = D   Z = E
```
2. Send the text **LFSL RFD PSTB DTZW NIJSYNYD FGTWY FGTWY RJJY FY XFKJ MTZXJ G**
