### Briefing: 
You're now well aware of the Slootmaekers supposedly legit business, the Bike Factory. Evidence is mounting up that the business, and especially its website, have quite a few things to hide. We've just had a tip-off that there's a **secret page** on the website with some interesting information about when the gang plan to attempt the eBike heist. Problem is, it seems to be **restricted**. Can you get access?

**Tip:** **Get access to the page** to get the flag.

### Hint:
Did you see the user= parameter in the URL? Try changing it to something else.

### How to Solve: 
1. In the URL, change `user=lars` to `user=admin`.

### Answer:
- READYSETGO!
